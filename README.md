**Online Shop for visually impaired person**


## THE GOAL 
This is a very little attempt to give the light to those people who doesn't have in their life. 
Tried to build an eCommerce site, from where a visually impaired person can buy products without 
the help of others.

The idea was proposed by Deepthy, and we all tried to make it real. We are trying to implent Face Recognition, 
and Fingerprint authentication. And more over to make the site userfriendly for Color Blind.

## HOW TO USE OUR SITE
Our eCommerce site is fully Voice-Controlled. 
Anyone can buy product by following the nerrated instructions.

For example, to listen "Available Products", it is needed to press "P", and then
it will start to nerrate products names and prices. 
To listen about an specific item, it needs to press "Ctrl" and then the product "title".
