# SUPERNOVA
**Online Shop for visually impaired person**


## THE GOAL 
This is a very little attempt to give the light to those people who doesn't have in their life. 
Tried to build an eCommerce site, from where a visually impaired person can buy products without 
the help of others.

The idea was proposed by Deepthy Nair, and we tried to make it real. Deepthy also proposed to add Face Recognition, but so far it's not done yet, we are working on it. It can also be added Fingerprint Authentication, which was first proposed by Joya Verma. It would be nice to make the site userfriendly for Color Blind.

## HOW TO USE OUR SITE
Our eCommerce site is fully Voice-Controlled. 
Anyone can buy product by following the nerrated instructions.

For example, to listen "Available Products", it is needed to press "Ctrl", and then
it will start to nerrate products' names and prices. 
To listen about a specific item, it needs to press "Ctrl" and then the product "title".

**N.B. Please pronounce CORRECTLY, and SLOWLY.**

## WHAT IS BEHIND THE SCENE
The project is built on Angular 7.
We use Firebase for user Login and Registrations.
CMS is used to display the products. We uploaded all our products data to a CMS site, and
it generated an API.
To convert Text to Speech & Speech to Text, we used SpeechSynthesis & SpeechRecognition API.

## HOW TO RUN
This project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.3.6. <br>
Run `ng start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## HOW TO DEVELOP
Anyone can develop our project. <br>
This project runs on Windows, we didn't try in other OS. 

**N.B. Presently our site is running only on google Chrome on Computer. Not Mobile Friedly.** <br>
