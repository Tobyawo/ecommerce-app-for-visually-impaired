# SUPERNOVA
Online Shop for visually impaired person


# THE TEAM & OUR GOAL 
We are the team of four Collaborators.
This is our very little attempt to give the light to those people who doesn't have in their life. 
We tried to build an eCommerce site, from where a visually impaired person can buy products without 
the help of others.

## HOW TO USE OF OUR SITE
Our eCommerce site is fully Voice-Controlled. 
Anyone can buy product by following the nerrated instructions.
For example, to listen "Available Products", it is needed to press "P", and then
it will start to nerrate products names and prices. 
To listen about an specific item, it needs to press "S" and then the product "title".

## WHAT IS BEHIND THE SCENE
The project is built on Angular 7.
We use Firebase for user Login and Registrations
CMS is used to display the products. We uploaded all our products info to a CMS site, and
it generates an API.
To convert Text to Speech & Speech to Text, we used SpeechSynthesis & SpeechRecognition.

## HOW TO RUN
This project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.3.6.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## HOW TO DEVELOP
Anyone can develop our project. 
It is permitted to use our codes partly or fully.
This project runs on Windows, we didn't try in other OS.
